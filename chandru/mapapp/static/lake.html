    The Thamirabarani or Tamraparni or Porunai is a perennial river that originates from the Agastyarkoodam peak of Pothigai hills
     of the Western Ghats, above Papanasam in the Ambasamudram taluk.[2] It flows through Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts of 
     the Tamil Nadu state of southern India into the Gulf of Mannar. It was called the Tamraparni River in the pre-classical period,
     a name it lent to the island of Sri Lanka. The old Tamil name of the river is Porunai. From the source to sea, the river is about 
     128 kilometres (80 mi) long and is the only perennial river in Tamil Nadu. This river flows towards north direction initially.
      However, it changes to east direction later.
